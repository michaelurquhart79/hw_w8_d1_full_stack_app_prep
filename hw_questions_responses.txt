Questions
What is responsible for defining the routes of the games resource?
from server.js:
  const gamesRouter = createRouter(gamesCollection)
  app.use('/api/games', gamesRouter);
..then create_router.js effectively creates the router.

What do you notice about the folder structure? Whats the client responsible for? Whats the server responsible for?
client is responsible for generating fetch requests (see GamesService.js) & displaying data.
server is responsible for routing the requests from the client and interacting with the db and returning data to the client as required.



What are the the responsibilities of server.js?
listening for requests from the client and returning only the data the client requires.


What are the responsibilities of the gamesRouter?
correctly interpreting the the requests from the client and generating the correct code to interact with the database. It also sorts out the result of the database operation and returns what is required to the client.



What process does the the client (front-end) use to communicate with the server?
fetch requests


What optional second argument does the fetch method take? And what is it used for in this application? Hint: See Using Fetch on the MDN docs
a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings.
For create and destroy we need to give it the HTTP verb (default is GET). for create it also needs a body (which is the payload stringified) and a header which defines the content type.


Which of the games API routes does the front-end application consume (i.e. make requests to)?
INDEX, CREATE, DESTROY


What are we using the MongoDB Driver for?
the internet tells me it does the following:

The official MongoDB Node.js driver provides both callback-based and Promise-based interaction with MongoDB, allowing applications to take full advantage of the new features in ES6. The 2.x series of the driver is powered by a brand new core driver and BSON library.

Not sure what this means though. Allows easier interaction with mongoDB using JS?
